This is my first project i have done.It's very easy c# project,where i create a insert button,delete button,update button and a search button.Here i take some values like ID,Name and Semester.If i want to insert values,then i have to give values properly,and tap insert button.If i want to delete a values of a person,then i have to push just ID value and tap delete button.Similarly ,if i want a see a person details,then i have to push the ID values and tap the search button.But the different is update button,if i want to update a value then i have to give the ID value and what i change Name and Semester value,and this value have to push there and tap the update button,then ok for update.Here one values are common that is ID values.I did all the work keeping ID value is same.
